## OpenSource

Some of the projects which i use, follow and contribute to. If you want to contribute or know more, reach out to me.

### [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
Awesome testing library, I've used it extensively for testing our Go services. [My commits](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/pulls?q=author%3Adevdinu+)
suites, mocks, tests, asserts and other helpful features for writing unit tests [readme](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/README.md).

### [Athens](https://github.com/gomods/athens)
Recently came across [gomods/athens](https://github.com/gomods/athens), after the gostudy group with [Caryolyn](https://github.com/carolynvs). This will serve as a proxy (you can host your mods) and registry.
Very diverse concepts and you can learn with community. 

### [Gocraft/Work](https://github.com/gocraft/work)
Background job processor, similar to sidekiq, rabbitmq if you've used. i've explored the code, and it was awesome to know how it (any job processor) works. Uses redis as storage.

### Other libs:
Other libs which're quite helpful writing REST sevices:
 * [negroni](https://github.com/urfave/negroni) - middleware stitcher, very simple but helpful when we've huge codebase, with modularised functionalities as middlewares
 * [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) - logging library
 * [envconfig](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig) - configuration loader, though there's alternate viper, i love this library, and its simplicity. concise code. you might know kelsey for [nocode](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode)
 * [mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) - router and dispatcher, when you've pathparams helps you to parse, similar functionality as negroni, and used to have context even before golang adopted it officially.
 * [migrate](https://github.com/mattes/migrate) - tool to run migrations against your db.
 * [cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli) - build enhanced commandline application. you don't need to parse flags, and assign actions
