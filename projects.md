# Pet Projects

## Chiru
Flying [crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/) quadcopter without controller, and using laptop 
like we do in game was absolute fun. seeing both hardware and software play together and seeing action, we should do it often.

## DevMacSetup
Evertime i had to setup laptop fresh, it was a big task, with ansible automated the requirements, mostly for me :)

## Sublime packages
Wrote few sublime packages, obviously starting for my need.
- [Share File](https://github.com/devdinu/ShareFile) : To share files across different sublime users
- [Preference Sync](https://github.com/devdinu/PreferenceSync) : sync my preferences and make sublime customized to me, across all machines, as in fresh/others sublime editors in other machine you could download and make it look/work like yours,

This was really nice, wish i had/have time to maintain and add more documentation to reach more users.

There were projects over time to learn languages, concepts. Fun projects stands out, and when there's a need and users we tend to build and maintain it. Its really hard to market it than building.



# Projects

[ToDo] Add projects with learnings and the findings, its not just about the code.
