# OpenSource

Some of the projects which i use, follow and contribute to. If you want to contribute or know more, reach out to me.

## [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- Awesome testing library, we use it for our services. [My commits](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/commits?author=devdinu)
- suites, mocks, tests, asserts, you should checkout testify [readme](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/blob/master/README.md).

## [Athens](https://github.com/gomods/athens)
- Recently came across [gomods/athens](https://github.com/gomods/athens), after the gostudy group with [Caryolyn](https://github.com/carolynvs). This will serve as a proxy (you can host your mods) and registry.
Very diverse concepts and you can learn with community. 

## [Gocraft/Work](https://github.com/gocraft/work)
- Background job processor, similar to sidekiq, rabbitmq if you've used. i've explored the code, and it was awesome to know how it (any job processor) works. Uses redis as storage.

## Other libs:
Other libs which're quite helpful writing REST sevices:
 * [negroni](https://github.com/urfave/negroni) - middleware stitcher, very simple but helpful when we've huge codebase, with modularised functionalities as middlewares
 * [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) - logging library
 * [envconfig](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig) - configuration loader, though there's alternate viper, i love this library, and its simplicity. concise code. you might know kelsey for [nocode](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode)
 * [mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) - router and dispatcher, when you've pathparams helps you to parse, similar functionality as negroni, and used to have context even before golang adopted it officially.
 * [migrate](https://github.com/mattes/migrate) - tool to run migrations against your db.
 * [cli](https://github.com/urfave/cli) - build enhanced commandline application. you don't need to parse flags, and assign actions


 I've fork of these in [devslives](https://github.com/devslives)
