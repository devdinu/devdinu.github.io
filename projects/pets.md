# Pet Projects

purely for fun, and my use :P 

## Gcloud-Client
Utility cmd application wrapper around gcloud compute to add `ssh keys` to compute machines with filter. (golang)
[code](https://github.com/devdinu/gcloud-client)

## Mirror
An echo server you could run locally to view the request data. You could add filter on methods, url (body, regex yet to do) and see it. (golang)
[code](https://github.com/devdinu/mirror)

## Dum-E
Helper shell scripts - which is of use at times, and at times needed the most. Just like stark's [dum-e](http://ironman.wikia.com/wiki/Dum-E_and_U)

<br/>

## Chiru
Flying [crazyflie](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/) quadcopter without controller, and using laptop
like we do in game was absolute fun. seeing both hardware and software play together and seeing action, we should do it often.

## DevMacSetup
Everytime i had to setup laptop fresh, it was a big task, with ansible automated the requirements, mostly for me :)

## Sublime packages
Wrote few sublime packages, obviously starting for my need.
- [Share File](https://github.com/devdinu/ShareFile) : To share files across different sublime users
- [Preference Sync](https://github.com/devdinu/PreferenceSync) : sync my preferences and make sublime customized to me, across all machines, as in fresh/others sublime editors in other machine you could download and make it look/work like yours,

This was really nice, wish i had/have time to maintain and add more documentation to reach more users.

There were projects over time to learn languages, concepts. Fun projects stands out, and when there's a need and users we tend to build and maintain it. Its really hard to market it than building.
